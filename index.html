						<p class="lede">Action on inequality.</p>
						<h6>Despite being the 7th biggest economy, we have 9 of the 10 most deprived areas in Western Europe. Policies to address this will alleviate so many issues our citizens face, from jobs to health, and housing and education.</h6>
						<p class="lede">A policy for a green economy.</p>
						<h6>A cleaner future and better jobs, via wide-scale investment in renewables, infrastructure for charging points, home insulation and green technology / bank and employment.</h6>
						<p class="lede">Housing</p>
						<h6>Really significant investment in public housing, plus a major review of the rental sector – rent control, rights for people renting, etc. UK housing is mad and must be reformed. It helps owners and renters to do this.</h6>
						<p class="lede">Tax</p>
						<h6>Root-and-branch reform of the UK tax rules, which are currently designed for (and by) tax-evaders to build in loopholes they can exploit. It is desperately unfair that the very rich can simply opt-out of their contribution to society, and it has to be fixed.</h6>
						<p class="lede">Wealth tax</p>
						<h6>Land value and / or wealth tax, to shift the balance away from taxing decent, productive work, and towards taxing the exploitation of assets. You are taxed for doing something useful, while the very wealthy escape tax for hoarding vital assets.</h6>
						<p class="lede">Reform of Parliament</p>
						<h6>Because it is now the largest in the world except China (a nation 21x bigger). Most parliamentarians aren’t elected, and it is horrifyingly ineffective. Making govt more representative and fairer will bring about improvements through all of society.</h6>
						<p class="lede">Reform of voting</p>
						<h6>Because FPTP is incredibly undemocratic and unrepresentative, compared with practically any other voting system. Why should your vote be worth less than other peoples’? Why should your opinion mean nothing because your MP is from another party?</h6>
						<p class="lede">Work and training</p>
						<h6>A new, properly funded vocational education choice, plus a life-long retraining service for a world where “jobs for life” no longer exist. We can’t abandon people who, aged 50, find their job has vanished. Retraining is better than paying benefits.</h6>
						<p class="lede">A national childcare service</p>
						<h6>Allowing lower paid workers and women greater freedom to work / earn, giving security and early education to kids, and ensuring carers are properly paid and treated well</h6>
					</div>
					<div class="c-recount">

						<p class="lede">Universal Basic Income</p>
						<h6>A commission to examine UBI, to face the challenge when automation makes millions of jobs obsolete. It's been trialled in Finland, and productivity didn't drop. And most people agree mass automation is coming. We should be ready for it.</h6>
						<p class="lede">Modern defence</p>
						<h6>A review of defence, focusing on proper care for veterans (a “patriotic welfare policy”), and a “Digital defence force” to protect UK interests against malign overseas influence and digital attacks</h6>
						<p class="lede">International</p>
						<h6>Reinstate Dept for International Development (or something very similar) and restate our international responsibilities and values – this includes “soft power” that rebuilds UK’s tarnished reputation</h6>
						<p class="lede">Corruption</p>
						<h6>A review of political funding, seeking a way to achieve fair, cheap, and representative public funding, and ban all other forms of funding. “Donations” lead to corruption. It must end.</h6>
						<p class="lede">Action on tax-havens.</p>
						<h6>And work with other countries to prevent digital giants from avoiding their responsibilities (and helping to wipe out high street jobs) by shifting money around the globe to avoid tax.</h6>
						<p class="lede">Action on media ownership</p>
						<h6>We are a nation which suffers some of the worst misinformation in the developed world. It cannot be right that so few people have so much control over what we get to hear about our government. </h6>
